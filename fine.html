          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Singapore experienced severe haze from 2015 to 2019 due to
            Indonesian forest fires, especially in Sumatra and Kalimantan.
            However, recent years have seen a decrease in haze, which sparked my
            team's interest to investigating these occurrences. In SMU's
            <b>IS415 Geospatial Analytics and Applications</b>, we learned how
            to use <b>R</b> to perform geospatial analytics. However, this
            method is not easily accessible to people without coding experience.
            Hence, we created <b>FINE: Fire INcidents Explorer</b>, an
            <b>R Shiny</b> web application that aims to allow users to perform
            spatial point patterns analysis on these occurrences through an
            intuitive user interface.
            <br />
            <br />
            Using R Quarto, we created a project website that outlines its
            features in greater detail, as well as a user guide for using the
            application. You can view via
            <a href="https://is415-fire-incidents-explorer.netlify.app/"

          <h2>Features</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>There are four key features to the application.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Exploratory Data Analysis:</b> Users can view an interactive
                point map of specific forest fire hotspots and filter them based
                on certain conditions, as well as time series charts that
                aggregates these points by time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Kernel Density Estimation Map:</b> Users are able to conduct
                first-order spatial point patterns analysis by viewing kernel
                density estimation maps of forest fire hotspots.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Spatial Cluster Analysis:</b> Users are able to conduct
                second-order spatial point patterns analysis to identify and
                statistically confirm possible interactions between events. This
                is done by conducting Monte-Carlo simulations to test for
                Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR), i.e. whether or not events in
                a given region are independently distributed and the number of
                events follows a homogenous Poisson distribution.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Spatiotemporal Analysis:</b> Users are able to conduct
                spatiotemporal analysis at point level and at area level. For
                point-level analysis, users can compute the space-time
                K-function for a specific sub-district in a specific year and
                view either a contour plot, image plot, or perspective plot of
                the results. For area-level analysis, users are able to view
                choropleth maps of aggregated fire hotspot data by sub-district,
                as well as identify changes in spatial hot spots and cold spots
                over time.

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The biggest takeaway from this project and the course as a whole is
            the knowledge of how to use R to perform data analysis and how to
            deal with geospatial data. Geospatial data has an added dimension to
            it that makes processing it slightly different from the typical
            tabular data that I was used to handling. But just as geospatial
            data requires additional steps to process, they also yield
            additional insights, and they can be used in conjunction with
            tabular data.

              >This Quarto website</a
            >
            is a compilation of the exercises I have done throughout the course,
            outlining the various techniques that can be applied to geospatial
            data.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although there were some challenges that came with having to learn a
            new language over the span of 3 months, I believe that learning R
            and geospatial data analytics was a very rewarding experience. In
            fact, I have managed to apply what I have learned in this course for
            my project in another course, where I created an agent-based
            simulation of the change in polar bear population in Hudson Bay. The
            techniques I learned in this course was useful to aggregate data in
            the area of interest, as well as to process that data to be imported
            into NetLogo.
