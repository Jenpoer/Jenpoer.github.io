          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The luxury goods market has seen significant growth due to rise of
            demand for high-end products worldwide. Consumers seek prestige and
            authenticity, but this has led to an increase in counterfeit goods.
            This rampant counterfeiting not only erodes brand revenues but also
            inflates operational costs as companies work to protect product
            authenticity, ultimately undermining consumer trust and brand
            equity. Despite regulatory changes and enhanced customs enforcement,
            counterfeiters continue to exploit system loopholes, particularly
            through online marketplaces, which account for around 31% of
            counterfeit sales. The growing online demand for luxury goods at
            lower prices has intensified these challenges, placing a financial
            strain on brands while diluting their market presence.
            <br />
            <br />
            Due to the decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature of
            blockchain, we saw an opportunity to utilize it to keep tamper-proof
            records of the lifecycle of a product. we propose a traceability
            system <b>LuxChain</b> for protecting against luxury counterfeits
            leveraging on a series of smart contracts.

          <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
          <p class="text">
            In LuxChain, <b>Ethereum</b> is used as the smart contract platform
            to develop an anti-counterfeit system that can be accessed by
            manufacturers, retailers, logistics providers, regulators, and
            consumers. It records the ownership of assets as it circulates in
            the market, proving its authenticity through traceability. This is
            done by issuing a <b>Digital Passport</b> alongside a physical
            product.

          <h2>User Flow</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Firstly, manufacturers create a unique digital ID for each luxury
            product based on a unique QR code or NFC, and information of each
            item is stored on the blockchain. This ID is available for anyone in
            the LuxChain blockchain to access and use to trace relevant
            information about the product and its ownership at point of sales
            for verification purpose. During a luxury goods transaction, the
            verification of authenticity can be done by matching the seller's
            wallet address to the owner's wallet address stored on the
            blockchain. Transfer of ownership for the digital identity using a
            smart contract can only be initiated by the owner's wallet.
            Consumers or buyers in the secondary marketplace will receive the
            new product ownership only if the current owner address and the
            product ID is the same as the ones recorded on the blockchain.

            The prototype is built using <b>React</b>. <b>web3.js</b> connects
            it to a series of smart contracts written in <b>Solidity</b> and
            deployed in the <b>Sepolia Ethereum TestNet</b>. The metadata of
            digital assets are stored using <b>Pinata IPFS client</b>. The code

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p class="text">
            This project was my first foray into Blockchain technology and I
            learned a lot through the course about its potential business use
            cases. The concepts of a dApp was surprisingly not too different
            from normal software engineering, once you get into the mindset that
            Blockchain essentially functions as a decentralized, immutable
            database. However, because of that immutability, there are some
            aspects to consider about deployment and data validation that are
            different from a normal application.
            <br />
            <br />
            Personally, had I been given more time for the project, I think that
            a public blockchain like Ethereum might not be the best choice for
            LuxChain. Ideally, LuxChain should be deployed using a permissioned
            blockchain like <b>Hyperledger Besu</b>, where it can be governed by
            validated manufacturing brands and roles can be assigned to
            different stakeholders in the system. Additionally, a lighter
            consensus mechanism like
            <b
              >Proof of Authority using QBFT (Quorum Byzantine Fault
              Tolerance)</b
            >
            can be used instead of a public blockchain's <b>Proof of Work</b>,
            saving costs on gas fees and compute.
