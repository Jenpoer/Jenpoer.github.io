          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            <b>TCS Sustainathon</b> is an annual competition hosted by Tata
            Consultancy Services aimed to encourage students to come up with
            technological innovations to solve real-world issues. TCS
            Sustainathon Singapore 2021's challenge theme is reimagining
            education, where participants can choose to address one of three
            specific challenge statements. Together with my friends, we chose to
            address the challenge statement "enhancing learners' experience in a
            blended learning environment". Having started a new chapter of our
            education during the Covid-19 pandemic, we deeply empathized with
            the problems caused by the sudden transition to blended learning,
            and sought to craft a solution for this.
          </p>

      <div class="timeline-box right">
        <div class="marker">

        </div>
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The challenge statement we chose to address is
            <b
              >"enhancing learners' experience in a blended learning
              environment"</b
            >. Specifically, we decided to tackle the problem of the
            <b>lack of human interaction</b> caused by the sudden transition to
            a virtual learning environment. Seeing the dire lack of human
            interaction as a major hindrance in online learning, we hypothesized
            that encouraging peer learning and forging a community through an
            online platform will help to mitigate its negative effects.

          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p class="text">
            We sent out a survey to approximately
            <b>30 university students</b> to validate our hypothesis and get an
            idea of the needs of our target audience. <b>71%</b> felt a lack of
            social interaction in online learning, with <b>44%</b> feeling that
            it was very difficult to make new friends in this environment.
            Despite this, <b>75%</b> required help from their peers for school
            work and <b>53%</b> had to turn to self-sourcing from the Internet.

      <div class="timeline-box right">

        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h2>Market Research</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Currently, other edtech platforms like <b>Brainly</b> and
            <b>Course Hero</b> focus on providing
            <b>convenient access to study materials</b> in the form of a
            crowdsourced QnA forum and notes / study documents respectively.
            Another platform that we felt might help students look for student
            tutors online is <b>Knack</b>. However, all of these platforms are
            disjointed, making it difficult for students to keep track of them.
            We also felt that there is a lack of
            <b>local community building</b> in these platforms, which is
            something that we would like to focus more on for our solution.

          <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Therefore, we proposed <b>Edugether</b>, an online peer-learning
              platform targeted towards university students, with gamified
              elements as incentives to help students get access to the study
              materials they need and connect students with their peers. There
              are 4 core features in our application:
            </p>
            <ul style="text-align: left">
              <li>
                <b>Notes Marketplace</b>: Marketplace where students can sell
                and purchase crowdsourced notes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Find a Study Group:</b> A platform for students to host and
                join study groups where they can meet new people.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>QnA Forum:</b> A forum where students can learn together by
                asking and answering each others' questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Tutor-Tutee Matching:</b> A platform where students can
                advertise their tuition services or look for student tutors
                willing to offer them tuition with ease.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        </div>
        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h2>Gamification</h2>
          <p class="text">
            To incentivize participation, we have
            <b>coins (virtual currency)</b> and <b>reputation system</b>. Using
            coins, users can buy study materials from the Notes Marketplace.
            Users can earn coins through active participation on the site, such
            as by posting in the forum, uploading their own study materials in
            the marketplace, or hosting/joining group study sessions. Users can
            also exchange the coins for rewards with real monetary value, such
            as vouchers. To allow users to gauge the quality of the content
            posted by other users, each user has a reputation level that is
            determined by how other users rate their contributions. The higher
            their reputation, the more rewards that they will be able to earn
            (e.g. their products will be priced higher in the marketplace).

          <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Edugether will also leverage machine learning technologies to
            streamline user experience. Using a
            <b>recommendation system</b>, we can deliver a more personalized
            experience that eases the users' process in finding what they're
            loooking for. We will also use <b>NLP in moderation</b> to help
            student moderators direct their attention to content flagged as
            inappropriate and ensure the quality posted on the site.

          <p class="text">
            Our solution was awarded the <b>first place winner</b> of TCS
            Sustainathon 2021/22 Singapore Finals! It was an incredible honor to
            be able to present our solution to an esteemed panel of judges and
            the Guest of Honour, President Halimah Yacob. Seeing the other
            competitors' creative solutions also inspired me. Having come from a
            very technical background, this competition challenged me to think
            of aspects other than technological viability, such as business
            feasibility (monetization, long-term sustainability, competitive
            advantages, etc.) and social impact.
