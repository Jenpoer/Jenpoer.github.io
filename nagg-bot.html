          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            In today's fast-paced world, staying informed and up to date with
            the latest news and developments has become more important than
            ever. However, the sheer expanse of available information can be
            overwhelming, making it difficult and time consuming to find news
            important and relevant to the individual. As such, our group
            developed a
            <b>Personalised News Aggregator Chatbot (a.k.a. NAgg)</b> to help
            users keep up with their daily news intake.

          <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
          <p class="text">
            <b>NAgg (News Aggregator Telegram Bot)</b> is designed to offer
            users personalized news article recommendations and assist with
            tasks such as summarization and answering questions based on recent
            news.
            <br />
            <br />
            While there are existing chatbots that provide similar
            functionalities related to news consumption and user interactions,
            such as CNN's chatbot on Facebook Messenger, NAgg offers a more
            nuanced user-centric experience by generating context-informed
            responses to queries and recommending articles based on the user's
            historical preferences.

          <h2>User Flow</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The overall system is implemented as a Telegram bot that users can
            interact with. When users first send a query, the query goes through
            the <b>Intent Classifier</b> module, where it is classified into one
            of the four features of NAgg: <b>General Queries</b>,
            <b>Article-Specific Queries</b>,
            <b>General (Content Filtering) Recommendations</b>, and
            <b>Topic Specific Recommendations.</b>

          <h2>Intent Classifier</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The Intent Classifier serves as the entrypoint of the chatbot, which
            redirects user queries through the four separate modules of NAgg. It
            is implemented using regex and a simple Recurrent Neural Network
            (RNN) that is trained on a custom dataset. The regex serves to
            detect if a URL is present in the query, which sends it to the Web
            Scraping module for processing, while the RNN is trained to classify
            the queries. The custom dataset is generated with the help of
            ChatGPT to mimic 500 different ways that a user might use the
            chatbot, combined with 250 questions taken from the Microsoft NewsQA
            dataset. These phrases are labeled as 'recommend_general',
            'recommend_specific', and 'other'.

          <h2>Web Scraper</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The Webscraping module is used for the Article-Specific Querying
            feature and to update our news databases. It is responsible for
            scraping the CNA API RSS feed every 3 hour and extracting the
            article content, before preprocesing it with the NLTK library and
            saving the articles into Firebase. Additionally, if users provide a
            link to make questions about a certain article, it will be passed to
            this module to be scraped and saved, before passing the news article
            as context to the LlaMa-2 module. The Webscraper for periodically
            scraping the CNA website is hosted in an Oracle Cloud Instance (and
            has since been deactivated after amassing ~1300 articles of data).

          <h2>Topic Specific Recommendations</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The Topic-Specific Recommendation leverages a vector database called
            ChromaDB, which stores the vector embeddings of the articles from
            the Firebase DB. When a user asks for specific recommendations,
            their queries are transformed into vectors and compared against the
            embeddings. The distinct links associated with the top 10 embeddings
            with the closest cosine similarity as the query vector will be
            returned to the user.

          <h2>General Recommendations</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Besides Topic-Specific Recommendation, we have also incorporated a
            Content-Based Filtering Recommendation system that analyses and
            tracks user-news interactions over time. This approach enables us to
            make personalised recommendations to users based on their historical
            preferences. To do this, we created a Utility Matrix that represents
            each user's "historical profile" as a vector. The user's profile is
            constructed by taking the average of the news embeddings of news
            that they have interacted with, as well as keeping track of their
            preferred category of articles (e.g. sports).

          <h2>General & Topic-Specific Querying</h2>
          <p class="text">
            We fine-tuned a LLAMA-2 model with 7 billion parameters on the
            NewsQA dataset using QLoRA, then used the Langchain library to
            integrate this model with our ChromaDB database (that is also used
            by the Topic-Specific Recommendation). This allows the model to
            answer general queries by using relevant document chunks as context,
            or to answer questions about a specific article that is passed into
            it by the Webscraping module.

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Overall, I am quite happy with the resulting product. Although we
            had to change direction and drop certain functionalities that we had
            originally wanted to to incorporate into the chatbot when we started
            the project (such as translation of articles), we were still able to
            deliver our key features of news summarisation and news
            recommendation, while adding news question answering to our
            chatbot's core features.
            <br />
            <br />
            I think that the biggest challenge of this project came in the form
            of hardware and budget limitations. Even with more efficient
            fine-tuning techniques like QLoRA, we still required the use of GPU
            in the cloud environment to train the model in a reasonable amount
            of time. Alas, we were not able to permanently keep the Telegram bot
            running due to budget constraints.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some future improvements to this project would be to increase the
            amount of training data we have to cover a greater breadth of
            queries, adding conversational memory, and attention mechanism to
            handle longer queries.
