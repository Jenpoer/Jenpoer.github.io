          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            <b>Jio Leh!</b> is a social food discovery platform created for
            SMU's <b>CS206 Software Product Management</b> course. The project's
            requirement was to come up with a viable software product with
            business potential, addressing a gap in the current market, and
            create the prototype of the software. Our team came up with the idea
            of Jio Leh! to help to increase eateries' discoverability, grow
            customer loyalty and guarantee conversions by leveraging
            user-generated content marketing via customer referrals and
            authentic social media posts. It was shortlisted for
            <b>SMU Eagles Inc.'s HATCH competition</b>, a startup pitching
            competition hosted annually by the club.

          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p class="text">
            During the Covid-19 pandemic, many F&B businesses took a hit because
            of the restrictions imposed on dining. They experienced low footfall
            as a result. However, even before the pandemic, traditional digital
            marketing strategies have not been very effective in directing
            traffic to their establishments, and is often a hassle for the
            vendors to maintain.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the other hand, the question of "what to eat?" is in everybody's
            minds every day. According to a preliminary survey conducted by the
            team, over <b>90%</b> of respondents discover new places to eat
            through word of mouth from friends or family, and over
            <b>40%</b> through social media influencers. But currently, there is
            a <b>lack of incentive</b> to actually spread the word about
            establishments through social media, despite people's reliance on
            social discovery to find new places to eat.
            <br />
            <br />
            Enter Jio Leh!, a social discovery platform for food!

          <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Jio Leh! is a <b>social discovery platform</b> for organic food
            posts, along with a <b>referral system</b> that serves to encourage
            users to try out new places. Unlike traditional digital marketing,
            our product encourages organic content creation by users, which
            would increase brand presence without the vendors having to actively
            manage their own social media page.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jio Leh! is distinct from other F&B referral and discovery apps, as
            it is an interactive app that not only acts as a means to spread the
            word about eateries, but also actively encourages conversions
            through our unique referral system. Our main target audience are F&B
            businesses looking to drive exposure and grow their loyal customer
            base.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <ol class="text">
            <li>Eatery X registers for a vendor account in Jio Leh!</li>
            <li>
              Eatery X sets up a promotional campaign and displays a
              verification QR code at their establishment.
            </li>
            <li>
              User A (referrer) visits Eatery X and scans their QR code. She
              then makes a post in Jio Leh!'s Foodstep Feed about her experience
              and tags Eatery X.
            </li>
            <li>
              User B (referree) sees User A's post about Eatery X and is
              convinced by her review to try dining there. He taps on the
              "Redeem" button, which generates a unique QR code.
            </li>
            <li>
              User B shows the staff his QR code for them to scan. He collects
              his freebie from the campaign.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text">
            And from this process, User B gets a freebie, User A gets monetary
            reward from her referral, and Eatery X gets a new customer!
            Furthermore, User B can create his own post about Eatery X and
            become a referrer himself, drawing in more customers to the eatery.

          <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Jio Leh!'s
            <b>three key features</b>
            aims to provide value for both
            <b>eateries</b>
            and
            <b>users</b>!
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <b>Foodstep Feed</b>: Eateries gain the benefit of crowdsourced
            marketing, removing the hassle of having to actively curate their
            own content. Meanwhile, users gain social engagement through
            authentic user-generated content.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <b>Campaign Creation</b>: Eateries have the flexibility of setting
            their own rewards and redemption limits. Meanwhile, users will gain
            benefits (such as a discount or freebies) when visiting an
            establishment referred by someone else.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <b>QR Referrals</b>: The referral system guarantees conversions per
            marketing dollar spent, whereby eateries will only need to pay for
            successful referrals instead of spending on traditional digital
            marketing methods (e.g. influencers) in advance. Users gain monetary
            incentive to spread the word about an establishment.

            <b>Sanity</b> (headless CMS with NoSQL database) as its backend. To
            simulate payments, we integrated Ethereum payment using
            <b>Metamask</b> into the prototype. However, Jio Leh! aims to
            support traditional forms of payment, such as credit/debit card, as
            well!

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p class="text">
            From this project, I learned a lot more about the holistic overview
            of creating and managing a software product, not just in terms of
            its development, but also its impact and commercial viability.
            Firstly, <b>careful feature selection</b> is important to fit target
            customers' requirements as well as be feasible to develop. Second, I
            learned that <b>a clearly defined product positioning</b> is crucial
            to gain a competitive advantage in the market. Thirdly, a team
            should have <b>effective communication</b> to align our vision and
            ensure a favourable working environment. Lastly, a
            <b>strategic roadmap</b> ensures that our product is competent to
            deal with changes in the market and the evolving nature of software
            products.
            <br />
            <br />
            While I think that Jio Leh! has some merit and may have some
            potential to be implemented as an actual product, I believe that it
            is still a far way from that goal. If we were to develop Jio Leh! as
            an actual product, we would have needed to conduct
            <b>requirements gathering at a larger scale</b> and a more
            <b>thorough market analysis</b>. A major drawback of the idea is
            also that it has not been tried and tested in an actual F&B setting.
            Thus, while the user journey sounds good on paper, it may prove to
            be much too complicated to implement in real life, where service has
            to be delivered at a rapid pace.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite this, I am thankful to both the faculty and my teammates for
            bringing me such an enjoyable and rewarding experience through this
            project, and I hope to be able to bring what I've learned a step
            further!
