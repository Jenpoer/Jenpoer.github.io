          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Our sponsor, GrabRentals, rents out vehicles to drivers for private
            hire and driving for Grab. However, when covered by a valid Medical
            Certificate (MC) and unable to drive, GrabRentals allows for the
            waiving of rental fees. Due to GrabRentals' growing fleet of rental
            vehicles and drivers, there is an increasing number of MCs to
            process each day. Hence, for our final year project, we created
            <b>Waftech MC OCR Tool</b> for our sponsor. The project aims to
            automate GrabRentals' medical leave and rental fee waiving process
            without completely disrupting their existing workflow.

          <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
          <p class="text">
            <b>Waftech MOT</b> is an OCR tool that automatically extracts
            necessary information from submitted MCs, verifies them against
            expected data, and writes the results onto the Google Sheets used in
            the existing process. Under the hood, it leverages the
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13318">LayoutLM</a> model
            available through the HuggingFace repository, which is fine-tuned on
            MC data provided by GrabRentals to perform better on the Singapore
            MC format. In addition to the <b>main MC processing module</b>,
            Waftech MOT comes with an <b>active learning pipeline</b> that
            allows the GrabRentals team to re-train the underlying model should
            they wish to improve its performance / keep it up to date with
            potential changes in the MC format. The entire solution is deployed
            on GrabRentals's <b>AWS environment</b>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our solution aims to promote scalability of their services, whilst
            reducing weekly hours in the task of processing MCs. Using our
            solution, we hope to help GrabRentals' operations team
            <b>reduce their weekly MC processing time</b> from 2-10 hours to
            under an hour.

          <h2>MC Processing Architecture</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The MC Processing Module of Waftech MOT consists of three steps:
            pre-processing, information extraction, and verification. They are
            deployed as different microservices using <b>Docker</b> and
            <b>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)</b> to promote loose
            coupling and enable us to independently develop and troubleshoot
            issues.
            <br />
            <br />
            The <b>pre-processing</b> service uses computer vision Python
            libraries such as <b>cv2</b> and <b>Pillow</b> to perform image
            rotation, shadow removal, and binarization. Afterwards, the
            pre-processed image is saved into an <b>S3 bucket</b> and sent into
            a <b>classifier</b> that will classify it into either an MC or
            another document. Other documents will be immediately flagged as
            invalid and will not proceed to the next step.
            <br />
            <br />
            The <b>information extraction</b> service uses LayoutLM to parse the
            pre-processed document and extract the corresponding fields. This
            information is then sent into the verification service.
            <br />
            <br />
            The <b>verification</b> service checks the clinic name against a
            database of registered clinics in Singapore, which was scraped from
            a legitimate database and stored into <b>Amazon RDS</b>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Afterwards, all the information is written into Google Sheets for
            the operations team to check.

          <h2>Active Learning Architecture</h2>
          <p class="text">
            For active learning, we hosted an open-source data labelling tool
            called <a href="https://labelstud.io/">Label Studio</a> and an
            open-source model registry called
            <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a> as separate microservices
            that can be accessed from the browser.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Label Studio</b> is connected to the S3 bucket of pre-processed
            images and the current version of the model. When a member of the
            GrabRentals team opens the annotation project, it will auto-annotate
            the images based on the predictions made by the current version of
            the model. The user can then adjust these labels accordingly and
            send the updated annotations to re-train the model.
            <br />
            <br />
            Using <b>MLFlow</b>, the user can view all versions of the model and
            their accuracy score against a dedicated "test set" of MCs. They
            will then be able to choose the best version to deploy for
            production use.
            <br />
            <br />
            With this active learning pipeline, we intend to make continued
            maintenance of this tool easier and more flexible for our sponsors,
            even past the duration of our involvement in the project.

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Although the requirement of the final year project was to create a
            proof-of-concept, we strived to create a tool that can benefit our
            sponsors in their processes. As such, this project was more
            challenging than our general school projects, where we had clear-cut
            deliverables already set by our professors. This was the first time
            I worked on a project with minimal guidance, where we were at the
            forefront of the stakeholder management. We had to independently
            communicate with our sponsors, clarifying requirements and keeping
            them updated on our progress. I am thankful that the team at
            GrabRentals has been nothing but supportive throughout this entire
            journey, being very responsive to our inquiries and providing us
            with the resources we need.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although the obligations of the final year project ended with the
            final presentation of the proof-of-concept at the end of the school
            term, we still felt responsible about delivering value to our
            sponsors. As such, we took a whole month after the end of the term
            to integrate the project to the sponsors' existing system.
            <br />
            <br />
            It was one of the most challenging projects I had embarked on up to
            the date of writing this page, but I am very grateful for the
            opportunity and lessons learned!
