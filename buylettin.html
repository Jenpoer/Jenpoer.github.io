          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text">
            <b>Build On, ASEAN 2021</b> is a competitive hackathon hosted by
            <b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b> that challenges students to create
            and innovate technological solutions to address challenge statements
            faced by the sponsors. My team decided to take on the challenge
            statement proposed by Carousell, which is "how might we encourage
            more people to buy and sell pre-owned items?". The competition
            consisted of two stages: a proposal submission stage and a final
            presentation for shortlisted proposals. Our proposal was shortlisted
            and we were given two weeks to create a prototype of our solution.

          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The challenge statement we chose to address is
            <b
              >"how might we encourage more people to buy and sell pre-owned
              items?"</b
            >. We felt that current secondhand C2C e-commerce marketplaces are
            largely one-sided and comes with various inconveniences that makes
            it a hassle for both buyers and sellers, thus turning them away from
            engaging in buying and selling secondhand products. Sellers may be
            hesitant to sell their items as they are unsure of the demand of
            such an item, while buyers are only limited to the items that
            sellers have posted on the platform. It is important to encourage
            the exchange of pre-owned items as it contributes to waste reduction
            and promotes local economic growth.

          <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Our proposed platform, <b>Buylettin</b>, introduces a
            <b>Buyer's Listing / Request Board</b> feature where buyers can list
            the items that they are looking to buy. With this request board,
            users can list items of interest and the description of the criteria
            that they are looking for. Keeping the traditional seller-side
            listings as well, a <b>recommendation system</b> that takes into
            consideration the similarity of listing keywords and user
            interactions will be utilized to connect both sides. Sellers will be
            recommended buyers' listings that are similar to an item that they
            have posted, and buyers will be recommended sellers' listings that
            are similar to the requests that they have put up. That way, C2C
            e-commerce becomes a <b>two-way process</b>: buyers do not
            necessarily have to be limited by listings that are already
            available and sellers are able to actively search for buyers.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, we have a <b>public QnA system</b>, where buyers can
            post questions about a product that is being sold, the answers to
            which will be made public. Buyers can also indicate questions on
            their request listings that they would like all sellers to answer
            when proposing a deal to them. This feature helps to streamline
            communication and minimize unnecessary repetitions of information
            between buyers and sellers.

          <h2>Market Research</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Buyer listings are already a feature of several other C2C e-commerce
            platforms, such as <b>Carousell</b>, <b>Gumtree</b>, and other
            online classifieds platforms. However, those features are usually
            sidelined and sometimes jumbled, with multiple categories being
            mixed together. We believe that by giving this feature more
            emphasis, we can fully utilize the idea of letting potential
            suppliers be aware of the presence of a demand to start drawing them
            into the market. We would also like to augment our solution with a
            specific recommendation system that is tailored specifically to it.
            Moreover, because this is already a familiar concept to users, it is
            easier for users to adopt, bypassing the general consumers'
            resistance to change.

          <h2>Prototype</h2>
          <p class="text">
            For this competition, we created a
            <b>functional prototype</b> deployed on <b>Amazon Cloud</b>. My role
            in this project was primarily full-stack development, though I was
            also in charge of DevOps. The frontend was coded using
            <b>React.js</b> and the backend was coded using <b>Spring Boot</b>.
            <br />
            <br />
            We deployed the prototype as a simple web application, using Amazon
            Elastic Beanstalk to help us set up the backend environment and
            deploying the frontend application as a static web in Amazon S3. We
            hosted our MySQL database in Amazon RDS. We also utilized Amazon
            Personalize for the recommendation system that aims to connect
            seller listings with buyer listings. Although this architecture is
            simple, we felt that it is sufficient for a prototype.

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Although we were shortlisted into the finals stage, we unfortunately
            did not win any prize. Upon reflecting upon this, I came to the
            conclusion that we were too focused on the engineering of the
            prototype that we failed to flesh out our idea, leading to the
            foundation upon which we built our product to be faulty. We spent
            most of our time trying to create a fully functional prototype,
            instead of simply creating just enough to showcase our features and
            better refine the idea behind it. As such, we were lacking in terms
            of solution impact and business viability, such as monetization.
            Apart from that, we had taken a very detached approach to the
            ideation of our product, failing to conduct enough primary research
            and empathizing with the would-be users of the product. However,
            these failings are a reward in its own right. Learning from my
            mistakes and the successes of the other teams, I am determined to go
            on to improve in my next endeavour!
